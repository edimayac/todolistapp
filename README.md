# TodoListApp

A **TodoListApp** that not only manages tasks but also has a built-in timer. Users can now know how much time it took to finish a task. A summary bar graph has been implemented to help users to keep track of all tasks that were timed.


# List of completed features:

- A database for storing the list including the ability to add and remove things from the To-do list.
- A timer to help keep track of work.
- A summary to show how much work has been completed.
- A hashtag to allow the categorization of assignments

## Known Issues:

- Summary graph will have multiple duplicates in the x-axis label

## Supported API levels:

- API: 31 ,32 is supported
- 30 and below seem to not be supported due to dependency.

## Test cases / test plans run:

- Add Items to the database and add them to the list by using the add button
- Remove Items to the database and add them to the list using the delete button
- Look for a task by using the search function.
- Test the timer.
- Look at the result in summary.

> Note: We created a function that inserts dummy data for testing. You will
> have to comment out the function detailed in the source code.
